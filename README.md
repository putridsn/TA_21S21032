# THE IMPACT OF AI-GENERATED CONTENT LABELING ON AI VIRTUAL INFLUENCERS' CONTENT ON CLOTHING PURCHASE INTENTION

## ABSTRACT
  The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in digital marketing is now widespread, with AI-Generated Virtual Influencers (AIVIs)—lifelike digital personas—gaining popularity, especially in the fashion industry, due to their ability to boost engagement and increase revenue. As AIVI usage grows, social media platforms have introduced AI-Generated Content Labels (AIGL) to ensure transparency. However, such labeling may impact consumer trust and purchase intention.
  This study examines the effects of AIGL on consumer perception in fashion marketing using AIVIs. It explores the relationship between AIGL (low: “AI-generated content”, high: “creator labelled as AI-generated”), perceived authenticity, and consumer trust, with AIVI facial expression (smiling vs. non-smiling) and platform type (TikTok vs. Pinterest) as moderating factors.
  A quantitative method was used with 205 respondents across Indonesia, and data were analyzed using Python. Findings indicate that AIGL significantly affects authenticity perception, trust, and purchase intention. Additionally, platform type and AIGL levels influence these perceptions in marketing H&M products using AIVIs on social media.

This research adapts the research model: PyProcessMacro model 9

## Method
1.	Questionnaire: It includes items assessing respondents’ opinions of marketing content that features AI-Virtual Influencer (AIVI) material, differentiated by platform (TikTok vs. Pinterest), facial expression (smiling vs. non-smiling), and the level of AI-Generated Label (AIGL) applied (low: “AI-generated content” vs. high: “creator labelled as AI-generated”).
2.	Literature study: Conducting such a review broadens understanding of the context and impact of AIVI and AIGL in social-media marketing content.

Description: 4/5 hypotheses in this study were accepted.

## Conclusion
  The hypothesis-testing results indicate that AI-Generated Labels (AIGL) embedded in AI-Virtual Influencer (AIVI) content shape consumers’ purchase intention for H&M apparel through the mediating mechanisms of perceived authenticity and consumer trust. The influence of AIGL on purchase intention is therefore indirect, operating via these two mediators. A high-level label; specifically, the disclosure “Creator labelled as AI-generated” is most effective at strengthening both mediators.
  Platform characteristics further differentiate purchase intention levels. TikTok, which is video-dominant, proves more conducive to stimulating purchase intention than Pinterest, which is image-dominant. By contrast, facial expression (smiling versus non-smiling) does not yield significant differences in purchase intention, implying that expression alone is not a central driver in this context.
  An effective strategy for elevating purchase intention in AIVI campaigns thus combines a high-level AIGL with a platform aligned to consumer preferences—here, a video-centric environment such as TikTok—thereby enhancing perceived authenticity and consumer trust through the joint effects of label transparency and platform type.
